# Better New Zealand

A Hearts of Iron IV mod that makes New Zealand good.

All features in modified code will have a nearby comment with the prefix "BNZ: " to make patching after updates easier.

`mod_info/description.md` contains a list of all of the features.

This requires my [HOI4 Mod Helper](https://github.com/Destructor-Ben/HOI4-Mod-Helper) to work.
