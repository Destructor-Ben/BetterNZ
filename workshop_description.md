[h2]Focus Tree Tweaks[/h2]
[list]
  [*]Completing the Waitangi Tribunal focus removes the political power cost of Ratana Alliance
  [*]In the Darkness and The Lee Affair have buffed autonomy and ideology drift
  [*]Befriend Japan focus requirements are clearer - both New Zealand and Japan must be fascist
  [*]Maori Volunteers focus no longer unlocks the decisions to demand islands, but has a better division template and gives stability and war support buffs
  [*]Rule Them All no longer gives a wargoal to conquer Australia if they have a different ideology to NZ (demand Australia focuses will be added in the future)
