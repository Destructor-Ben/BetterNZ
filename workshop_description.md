Better New Zealand is a mod that makes New Zealand less like the Luxembourg of the Pacific.

This mod is in active development and is subject to change.

[h2]Unite Polynesia Section of Focus Tree[/h2]
The Unite Polynesia decisions have been moved into focuses and expanded upon.

Furthermore, 3 states are cored when Polynesia is united but used to be unable to be demanded (Taiwan, Pitcairn Island, and Easter Island). This has been changed. Islands can also be demanded after Polynesia is formed. The cores on Polynesia are also obtained when the Demand Pacific Islands focus is completed instead of when Polynesia is united.

Some focuses in the shared part of the focus tree have also been changed:
[list]
  [*]Completing Waitangi Tribunal removes the political power cost of Ratana Alliance
  [*]Maori Volunteers no longer unlocks the decisions to demand islands, but has a better division template that is unlocked and gives stability and war support buffs
[/list]

[h2]Tweaked Political Section of Focus Tree[/h2]
2 new focuses have been added for the Commonwealth involving trading with Australia and Malaysia.

There are also 2 new politcal paths, both for Non-Aligned. The first creates a monarchy with Edward The VIII as king after his abdication, and the second starts a civil war between the Maori and Pakeha with you playing as the Maori.

The vanilla political paths have additionally recieved some tweaks:
[list]
  [*]In the Darkness and The Lee Affair have buffed autonomy and ideology drift
  [*]Befriend Japan focus requirements are clearer - both New Zealand and Japan must be fascist
  [*]Befriend Japan and Rule Them All have a new focus (Purge Commonwealth Traitors) as a prerequisite to match the Communist branch
  [*]Rule Them All no longer gives a wargoal to conquer Australia if they have a different ideology to NZ
  [*]Rule Them All is included in the communist branch as well
  [*]Rule Them All now has a war support buff
  [*]Empower the Working Class and Independent New Zealand no longer force you to leave the allies
  [*]Independent New Zealand gives a new idea that buffs stability, war support, and manpower
