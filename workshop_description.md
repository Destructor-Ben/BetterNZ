Better New Zealand is a mod that makes New Zealand less like the Luxembourg of the Pacific.

This mod is in active development and is subject to change.

[h2]Unite Polynesia Section of Focus Tree[/h2]
The Unite Polynesia decisions have been moved into focuses and expanded upon.

Furthermore, 3 states are cored when Polynesia is united but used to be unable to be demanded (Taiwan, Pitcairn Island, and Easter Island). This has been changed. Islands can also be demanded after Polynesia is formed. The cores on Polynesia are also obtained when the Demand Pacific Islands focus is completed instead of when Polynesia is united.

[h2]Focus Tree Tweaks[/h2]
[list]
  [*]Completing the Waitangi Tribunal focus removes the political power cost of Ratana Alliance
  [*]In the Darkness and The Lee Affair have buffed autonomy and ideology drift
  [*]Befriend Japan focus requirements are clearer - both New Zealand and Japan must be fascist
  [*]Maori Volunteers focus no longer unlocks the decisions to demand islands, but has a better division template and gives stability and war support buffs
