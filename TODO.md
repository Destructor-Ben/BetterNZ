### Balance/Tweaks
- Maybe make the forts focus only give the bonus to a few random islands, since if it does all, then you may as well wait to get all of them
- Could also make the Develop Polynesia focuses unlock decisions instead, and have a decision for each island
- Could also make the demand islands decisions more controlled by having a decision for each state

### Code Quality
- Make RPS and APS lists in code
