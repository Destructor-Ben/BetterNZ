## Future
### Content
- Add more states to the map for islands
- Add more government employees and generals
- Add more initial research for NZ

- Add new flag for communist NZ
- Maybe make new flags for Polynesia

- Add more economy focuses - Iron Sand?
- Add more navy focuses - It needs to be possible for nz to invade Australia

### Balance/Tweaks
- Maybe make the forts focus only give the bonus to a few random islands, since if it does all, then you may as well wait to get all of them
- Could also make the Develop Polynesia focuses unlock decisions instead, and have a decision for each island
- Could also make the demand islands decisions more controlled by having a decision for each state
- Could move the Polynesia focuses to the same place as Australia focuses - maybe not, since the australia are just after the other focuses
