### Balance/Tweaks

- Make RPS and APS state lists in code - ETH_transfer_promised_states
- Road to '56 compatability
- Maybe make the forts focus only give the bonus to a few random islands, since if it does all, then you may as well wait to get all of them
- Could also make the Develop Polynesia focuses unlock decisions instead, and have a decision for each island
- Could also make the demand islands decisions more controlled by having a decision for each state
- Could move the Polynesia focuses to the same place as Australia focuses - maybe not, since the australia are just after the other focuses
